One of the main challenges I faced during the lab was getting used to writing logic in assembly language, since itâ€™s so different from higher-level languages. It took some trial and error to figure out how to correctly use conditional jumps and work with uninitialized variables. Debugging with GDB was also a bit confusing at first, but after following the steps from the lecture, I got more comfortable seeing how the values changed as the program ran. Overall, it was a good learning experience, even though the low-level details were tricky at times.
