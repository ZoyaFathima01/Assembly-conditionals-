One major challenge was translating the logic for finding the largest number and generating even numbers from high-level pseudocode into low-level assembly instructions, especially when working with registers and memory addressing. It was also challenging to ensure that variables were correctly initialized and uninitialized as required by the assignment, since errors in this area can cause incorrect results or runtime errors. Implementing the conditional logic using jumps (e.g., jle, jg) and making sure the program looped the correct number of times needed careful attention to detail. Finally, setting up and using the GDB debugger with the correct parameters (layout asm, layout regs, watch, etc.) was initially confusing, but became clearer with practice.
